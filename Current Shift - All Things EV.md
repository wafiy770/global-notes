will you accelerate gently, or floor the gas pedal at every opportunity

### How to get the most out of your EV battery

Ever been in a dire situation, where your fuel warning turns bright red, checked your waze and the nearest petrol pump is a few km over your estimated driving range

So you signal left, change to the left lane, drive slower, restrain yourself from flooring the gas pedal at every opportunity, and to some extend pressed down your windows and turn off the air-conditioning, pray there's no traffic congestion ahead and smack your head for not checking the fuel level before driving -- yet again.

Pat yourself on the back and call yourself an engineer -- since you are technically minimizing the fuel consumption to get the most out of your remaining fuel. Eventhough the actual engineer works on optimizing the combustion mechanism and efficient transmission to minimize the fuel consumption. Just don't add ridiculously big spoiler -- it pushes your car downwards providing stability at very high speed (which you should not be doing), but at the expense of significantly more fuel consumption 

Here's what's happening under your hood:
- Drive slower -->  Average speed decrease --> Fuel consumption decrease --> Driving range increases
- Stop flooring the pedal --> Rapid acceleration decrease --> Fuel consumption decrease --> Driving range increases
- Turn off AC --> AC load decreases --> Fuel consumption decrease --> Driving range increases
- Smooth traffic --> Amount of acceleration decrease --> Fuel consumption decrease --> Driving range increases

Well, the common denominator is reducing fuel consumption. Now, can the same be said for an EV?
The answer is yes - but not exacly. Here's why

speed & acceleration - battery wear and tear
	speed - the devil here is air resistance, the higher your speed the stronger the air resistance - 
ac - separate system in front hood and cabin

stop & go - consumptions during idling
	for ice engine, to keep your engine running eventhough it is not moving, you need to keep burning fuel, that's the idle fuel consumption- if not you need to keep restarting your car engine every time you stop

make it about regenerative breaking and idle power consumption?!

So, eventhough the mechanics on how ICE vehicles and EV fuel/energy consumption is different, factors affecting their consumption are still similar.

So the next time you're driving and EV and got into the same situation - because you keep forgetting to check your fuel/battery level, now you know what to do

The estimated driving range will have slight trouble predicting your driving behaviour, road topography and traffic congestion

so use this to manually adjust the estimated driving range



the two biggest factor is air resistance and rolling resistance
- your ev aerodynamics
- the speed at which you are driving
- the weight of your car
- road topograhpy - flat road or uphill


accelerating heavily and then slowing will use more fuel than a consistent cruise

Now is it the same when you are driving an EV?
the answer is yes - but not exactly, here's why

ICE

battery capacity & state of charge
- lower soc, the internal resistance is higher - generates more heat

temperature

should you roll down your window - yes
- ev usually have separate thermal management system for the front boot (where the battery and engine is located) and the cabin environment
- but it still consume the battery to provide air conditioning
- utilise pre conditioning, gets your cabin to a suitable temperature while charging - use the power from the charging station instead of your battery 

if ev is affected by temperature, why does the front boot doesnt have vent like normal cars
first instinct with air blowing in - cooler, better performance
air is ambient temperature, with ice engine significantly lower
with traditional engine it gets very significantly hot - since you are literally burning fuel in the engine, so you need to have vent
with ev the temperature is siginificantly lower, and since temperature has significant impact on batter performance, you want to be able to control the temperature inside the boot, hence the front boot of ev is usually sealed and equip with its own thermal management system

what affects ev battery consumption

so the next time your range anxiety kicks in and you need to squeeze the extra kilometers, remember these xxx


There are four main factors, in order of importance.

- Air resistance.
- Rolling resistance
- Weight
- Driving style.

Air resistance is the biggest factor once you get over about 40–50 mph (65–80kph). It increases in a squared relationship as more and more air piles up in front of the car the faster you go. EVs are generally much more aerodynamic than fossil fuel cars to minimise this problem.

Rolling resistance is linear. So it is doubled at 20mph compared to 10mph and doubled again by 40 mph. Having low rolling resistance tyres helps a lot, however, in my experience they also lack a little accelerating and braking grip and can be prone to slip a little under acceleration.

Weight. The heavier the overall vehicle the more effort it is to make it move, and the greater rolling resistance is, which is one of the reasons why we inflate tyres to higher pressures when heavily loaded and given that regen braking is not 100% efficient you cannot recover all of the extra momentum you get with greater mass.

Driving style. Whilst it shouldn’t make that much difference whether you brake hard or accelerate hard and in pure physics-terms it doesn’t, and electric drive systems are a bit less efficient under high loads, so gentle driving uses less energy.


Driving range in electric vehicles is affected by several factors, just as it is in an internal combustion engine vehicle. We are not as aware of it in an ICE vehicle because a fuel gauge does not give us a precise measurement of what’s in the tank. Some luxury gasoline cars also display remaining fuel in miles, but those numbers are also a rough approximation based on a simple formula.

When navigating to a destination, such as a Supercharger station, Tesla uses a complex formula to determine remaining driving range. It takes into account average energy consumption (in Watt-hours per mile), outside temperature, AND the topography of the route between the vehicle and the destination. Yes, you read that correctly.

Tesla’s navigation system, which is standard equipment, was co-developed by Tesla and Google. Using Google’s elevation data, the car can predict with 1% accuracy how much range will be left when you arrive at your destination. This prediction is updated regularly while you drive, just in case anticipated conditions change. I’ve used Tesla’s navigation system many times for trips in my Model S, and the range predictions are uncannily accurate. In seven years of Tesla ownership, I have never run out of energy.

When driving an electric vehicle without smart navigation, you can quickly add range by simply slowing down 5 or 10 MPH. The amount of energy consumption at 75 MPH is substantially more than at 65 MPH. The same is true of any ICE vehicle. It’s just not as obvious due to lack of accurate information.

When I received my first Tesla Model S in 2013, the navigation system did not have range prediction capabilities yet. This meant that drivers of early Teslas had to do the math in their heads. After some experimentation, I determined that the displayed range in my 2013 Model S was roughly equivalent to driving at 60 MPH on a flat, level highway with no wind, and an outside temperature of 70F. Driving at 50 to 55 MPH on secondary roads gave me more than the displayed range, and driving at 75 MPH on the highway gave me less.

Since the heating in electric vehicles is electric, driving in winter temperatures will also affect range. Tesla’s navigation system takes this into account because the heater increases the overall Wh/mile energy consumption. ICE vehicles also use more fuel in very cold temperatures, but for a different reason: increased friction in the powertrain.

I have never found the reduced winter range in my Tesla to be a big deal. It has never prevented me from going where I need to go. I’ve made trips at -10F without a problem.

When you charge an electric car, including a Tesla, the range displayed on the display is determined using a standard formula. Tesla uses a similar method as the EPA to determine range, but as mentioned above, it is affected by several factors once you begin driving.

- thermodynamics consideration
a. **Transient Operating Conditions**: Rapid acceleration and deceleration induce transient operating conditions within the engine, necessitating fuel enrichment during acceleration phases to meet the increased power demand. This enrichment alters the air-fuel mixture ratio, deviating from the optimal stoichiometric ratio, thereby leading to inefficient combustion and increased fuel consumption.

b. **Cycle Efficiency Variations**: Abrupt throttle inputs during aggressive driving maneuvers disrupt the ideal thermodynamic cycles within the engine, causing deviations from the optimal compression-expansion processes. These deviations manifest as higher heat losses, incomplete combustion, and increased frictional losses, all of which contribute to reduced cycle efficiency and elevated fuel consumption.

- mechanical effects
a. **Drivetrain Losses**: Abrupt throttle inputs necessitate rapid adjustments in torque delivery, leading to transient loading conditions on the drivetrain components. These transient loads induce higher mechanical losses within the transmission, differential, and driveline, resulting in increased parasitic losses and reduced mechanical efficiency.

b. **Braking Energy Dissipation**: Aggressive braking maneuvers demand rapid dissipation of kinetic energy, primarily achieved through frictional braking mechanisms. However, this energy dissipation process entails significant losses due to brake pad wear, disc heating, and brake system inefficiencies, thereby representing a direct conversion of fuel energy into thermal energy without contributing to propulsion, thus exacerbating fuel consumption.

- control system response
a. **Fuel Injection Dynamics**: Sudden throttle inputs necessitate rapid adjustments in fuel injection timing, duration, and pressure to maintain engine stability and prevent lean or rich combustion conditions. These rapid adjustments induce transient response delays within the fuel injection system, resulting in non-optimal fuel delivery and combustion characteristics, ultimately leading to increased fuel consumption.

b. **Ignition Timing Variability**: Aggressive driving maneuvers necessitate instantaneous adjustments in ignition timing to accommodate the altered combustion dynamics induced by rapid throttle changes. However, these adjustments may deviate from the optimal ignition timing profiles, leading to incomplete combustion, increased exhaust gas temperatures, and elevated fuel consumption.

- powertrain efficiency consideration
a. **Transient Power Requirements**: Aggressive driving maneuvers, such as rapid acceleration, demand instantaneous increases in power output from the electric motor. This necessitates rapid adjustments in motor torque and current, potentially pushing the motor beyond its optimal operating conditions and reducing overall efficiency.

b. **Losses in Power Electronics**: Abrupt throttle inputs trigger rapid changes in power demand, requiring corresponding adjustments in the power electronics (inverters, converters) to regulate voltage and current flow. However, such rapid modulation of power electronics can lead to increased switching losses, reducing overall efficiency.

ev

for driving behaviour
- energy management system dynamics
a. **Battery Current Demand**: Aggressive driving behavior leads to higher instantaneous power demands from the battery pack to supply energy to the electric motor. This results in higher discharge currents, which can increase internal resistance losses within the battery cells and reduce overall energy efficiency.

b. **Battery Thermal Management**: Rapid discharge and charge cycles induced by aggressive driving can elevate the operating temperature of the battery pack. Elevated temperatures can degrade battery performance and accelerate aging, leading to increased internal resistance and reduced energy capacity over time.

- regenerative braking optimization
a. **Regenerative Braking Response**: Aggressive braking maneuvers necessitate rapid engagement of regenerative braking systems to capture kinetic energy and convert it into electrical energy for storage in the battery pack. However, aggressive braking may exceed the regenerative braking capacity, leading to reliance on friction brakes and energy dissipation as heat.

b. **Regenerative Braking Efficiency**: Optimizing regenerative braking algorithms to match driver behavior and vehicle dynamics is crucial for maximizing energy recapture during deceleration. Aggressive braking may require higher regeneration rates, but if not appropriately tuned, it can result in inefficient energy conversion and reduced overall system efficiency.

- control system adaptation
a. **Drive Mode Selection**: Advanced control algorithms in modern EVs adjust powertrain response based on driver input and driving conditions. Aggressive driving may trigger dynamic adjustments in drive mode selection, favoring performance-oriented modes that prioritize power delivery over energy efficiency.

b. **Adaptive Cruise Control**: Integration of adaptive cruise control systems can moderate driver behavior and optimize energy consumption by maintaining consistent speeds and minimizing unnecessary acceleration and deceleration events.


for temperature
battery performance and thermal management
a. **Internal Resistance**: Temperature affects the internal resistance of battery cells, altering their electrochemical behavior during charge and discharge cycles. High temperatures decrease internal resistance, enabling higher power output but increasing the risk of thermal runaway and capacity fade. Conversely, low temperatures increase internal resistance, limiting power output and reducing energy efficiency.

b. **Capacity Degradation**: Extreme temperatures, both hot and cold, accelerate degradation mechanisms within battery cells, leading to reduced energy capacity and diminished overall performance over time. Proper thermal management systems, such as active cooling or heating, are crucial for maintaining optimal battery temperature and mitigating capacity fade.

powertrain efficiency consideration
a. **Motor Performance**: Temperature affects the efficiency and performance of electric motors. High temperatures can lead to increased winding resistance and core losses, reducing motor efficiency and power output. Conversely, low temperatures can stiffen lubricants and increase mechanical losses, further diminishing motor efficiency.

b. **Power Electronics Operation**: Temperature impacts the operation of power electronics components, including inverters and converters. High temperatures can degrade semiconductor materials and increase switching losses, reducing power electronics efficiency and overall drivetrain performance.

cabin heating and cooling system
a. **Energy Consumption**: Temperature control systems for cabin heating and cooling draw power from the battery pack, contributing to overall energy consumption. Extreme temperatures necessitate higher energy inputs for cabin comfort, particularly in regions with harsh climates.

b. **Thermal Comfort Optimization**: Advanced thermal management algorithms optimize cabin temperature while minimizing energy consumption. Efficient HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) systems, coupled with intelligent temperature control strategies, help balance occupant comfort with energy efficiency.

regenerative braking efficiency
a. **Battery Temperature Effects**: Temperature influences the effectiveness of regenerative braking systems. Low temperatures reduce battery efficiency and decrease the rate of energy recapture during deceleration, limiting the overall effectiveness of regenerative braking and necessitating higher reliance on friction brakes.

b. **Regenerative Braking Optimization**: Temperature-dependent regenerative braking algorithms adjust braking force and regeneration rates based on battery temperature and state of charge. Optimal tuning of these algorithms ensures efficient energy recapture while preventing overcharging or overheating of the battery pack.

for battery capacity and state of charge

available energy for propulsion
a. **Battery Capacity**: Battery capacity defines the total amount of energy stored within the battery pack, representing the maximum energy available for propulsion. A higher battery capacity allows for longer driving ranges between charging cycles, reducing the frequency of recharging and overall energy consumption.

b. **State of Charge (SOC)**: SOC indicates the percentage of available energy remaining in the battery relative to its maximum capacity. Higher SOC levels correspond to greater energy availability for propulsion, enabling extended driving ranges and reducing the need for frequent recharging.

powertrain efficiency consideration
a. **Efficiency at Different SOC Levels**: Powertrain efficiency may vary depending on the SOC of the battery. Some components, such as electric motors and power electronics, may exhibit different efficiency characteristics at various SOC levels, impacting overall drivetrain efficiency and energy consumption.

b. **Voltage and Current Characteristics**: Battery SOC influences voltage and current characteristics during discharge cycles. Operating the battery at different SOC levels may result in varying voltage outputs and current draw, affecting drivetrain performance and energy efficiency.

battery thermal management
a. **Temperature Dependence**: SOC can influence the thermal behavior of the battery pack, particularly during high-power discharge cycles. Operating the battery at lower SOC levels may lead to higher internal resistance and increased heat generation, potentially affecting battery temperature and performance.

b. **Cooling and Heating Requirements**: Battery thermal management systems must account for SOC-dependent thermal dynamics to ensure optimal operating conditions. Cooling systems may need to work harder to dissipate heat generated during high-power discharge cycles at lower SOC levels, impacting overall energy consumption.

range and energy management
a. **Range Estimation**: SOC serves as a critical input for range estimation algorithms, which calculate the distance that can be traveled based on the available energy in the battery pack. Accurate SOC estimation is essential for informing drivers of remaining range and optimizing energy management strategies.

b. **Energy Management Strategies**: SOC influences energy management strategies, including power allocation, regenerative braking control, and predictive energy optimization. These strategies aim to maximize vehicle efficiency and extend range by intelligently managing energy consumption based on SOC levels and driving conditions.

volkswagen ID.2all concept
- to minimize cost
- volkswagen group build lithium-ion battery gigafactory in Spain
- The ID.2all will be FWD which is too bad for those of us who prefer a compact hatchback with great handling. It appears to have a very basic beam-type rear suspension to keep costs low and maximize interior volume. Its battery pack should help minimize its front weight bias, but it will suffer from the fast front tire wear, torque steer, large turning circle, etc., of FWD. Oh well, if it's inexpensive, it should appeal to many.
- RWD is best because acceleration causes a rearward shift in weight improving traction whereas this weight shift loses traction for FWD. RWD also keeps power and steering separate which is good for both.
- FWD works with ICE because the engine, gearbox/transmission and drive shafts are all at the front, do not intrude into the cabin and the weight of the engine is over the driven wheels giving good traction at low power.
- Traditional ICE vehicles with RWD do not have the weight of the engine over the driven wheels which is why traditional RWD vehicles have traction problems on snow and ice.
- The best solution is RWD with weight in the centre. This is found in all Formula 1 cars and exotic super cars, however, that leaves no space for passengers behind the driver. This problem is solved by EVs which have the weight of the battery centrally located.
- Volvo and Polestar have just worked this out! The Volvo XC40 and Polestar 2 were modified from existing ICE platforms and, the single motor versions, had FWD. in 2023 this has been fixed and they now are RWD.
- VW have just gone from the ID3 with a great chassis and terrible software and are about to evolve to a terrible chassis to go with the terrible software. Renault have adopted Android Automotive but spoiled the Megane e-Tech with FWD. Renault have had to limit power and you cannot get 100% until 50 mph to mitigate wheel spin. The answer to the question why is that is what ICE engineers are familiar with and they think it is a bit cheaper . . . .
- People complained that the design of their ID cars was too futuristic. VW acknowledged that these were designed for early adopters and that they needed to design something that looks more like a regular car.

SEO 2.0: How to adapt to the future of search
https://www.revenuemarketingalliance.com/seo-2-0-how-to-adapt-to-the-future-of-search/
- SGE concept - Search Generative Experience. Instead of seaching for links that may have answer to your question, it will generate the answer straight away
- Impact - When people are googling, they might not even click any recommended page link. Just look at the answer. So, click through rate (traffic) will be minimized
- But, after the first instance of googling, they will also ask follow-up questions -- which will be more specific/niche
- For example, look at the 'People also ask' section in the
- Goal is to optimize for this follow up questions
- But it’s important to remember that informational search isn’t just about getting the facts. Searchers are instead often seeking advice and guidance in the form of unique perspectives, opinions, and first-hand accounts.
- One thing we can be sure of is that SEO strategies that rely on answering basic questions and offering the “facts”, will be quickly rendered obsolete in a world where AI snapshots can handle basic informational search.
- basic answers can be generated by AI, so focus on what can't -- informed opinion and personal experience
- so instead of having professional copywriter (replace this with AI) and curate the generated content (the tagline nowadays - AI generated, professionally curated), now it's more about being subject matter expert
- should focus on creating long form contents, and use AI to transform into individual platform format
- all this subchannels should redirect to the long form contents, which should be hosted on your own (domain and hosting( preferably host from own cloud subscription - or use third party website hosting))
- Its still unclear how google selects pages that appear within its AI snapshot
- focus on:
	- building deeper topic clusters
	- covering a wider range of queries
	- addressing narrower, more specific audiences
- instead of 'How to Set Up GA4', do 'GA4 for e-commerce websites' or 'GA4 for publishers'
