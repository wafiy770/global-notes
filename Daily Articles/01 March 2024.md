https://www.indiehackers.com/article/f7697df2d7

- some companies start as side projects - so spend some time on side projects after work
- start side projects that complements your core job - so at the very least, can directly benefits you at work
- no risk/pressure involves, unlike core job - so go crazy, and explore
- find the leftover minutes before/after work, and see it as just hanging out with your projects. deadlines should not be as restrictive as your core job
- to find value in the side projects, focus on the orbiting pain points that are surrounding the main/key pain points, which are dealt with in your main jobs
- eg: core jobs - develop pbi dashboard, side projects - create repo with default styling
- treat side projects as experiments, allow it to fail
- setting goals will results in resentment if it fails
